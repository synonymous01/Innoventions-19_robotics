# Innoventions 2019 Project X
 ## A Robotics competition I designed in high school for high school students

This repository contains arduino code to run small rovers with three configurations:
- Line following
- Wall following
- Bluetooth teleop

Contestants were given points to spend on which configuration they wanted to build. Then, a race was conducted using a special arena and points were given based on time taken to do a lap. Winner was the team with the most points
